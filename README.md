# Spring Boot Application Runner

## Overview

Spring Boot Application Runner is a feature that allows you to execute code after the Spring ApplicationContext has been initialized. It's particularly useful for running specific tasks or initializing components when your application starts up.

## Features

- **Post-Initialization Execution**: Run code after Spring Boot has fully started.
- **Multiple Runners**: Define and use multiple Application Runners in a single application.
- **Ordering**: Control the execution order of multiple runners.
- **Dependency Injection**: Utilize Spring's dependency injection in your runners.
- **Exception Handling**: Proper exception handling during application startup.
- **Conditional Execution**: Use Spring's conditional annotations to control when runners execute.

## Getting Started

1. **Add Dependency**

   Ensure you have the Spring Boot starter in your `pom.xml`:

   ```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
       <artifactId>spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
   </dependency>
   ```

2. **Create an Application Runner**

   Implement the `ApplicationRunner` interface:

   ```java
   import org.springframework.boot.ApplicationArguments;
   import org.springframework.boot.ApplicationRunner;
   import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

   @Component
   public class MyApplicationRunner implements ApplicationRunner {
       @Override
       public void run(ApplicationArguments args) throws Exception {
           System.out.println("This will be executed after the application starts");
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Run Your Application**

   Start your Spring Boot application as usual. The `run` method of your Application Runner will be executed automatically.

## Configuration

You can configure multiple Application Runners and control their order:

```java
@Component
@Order(1)
public class FirstRunner implements ApplicationRunner {
    // Implementation
}

@Component
@Order(2)
public class SecondRunner implements ApplicationRunner {
    // Implementation
}
```

## Usage Examples

1. **Database Initialization**

   ```java
   @Component
   public class DatabaseInitializer implements ApplicationRunner {
       @Autowired
       private DataSource dataSource;

       @Override
       public void run(ApplicationArguments args) throws Exception {
           // Initialize database schema or load initial data
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Cache Warming**

   ```java
   @Component
   public class CacheWarmer implements ApplicationRunner {
       @Autowired
       private CacheManager cacheManager;

       @Override
       public void run(ApplicationArguments args) throws Exception {
           // Pre-load data into cache
       }
   }
   ```

## Best Practices

1. Keep Application Runner logic concise and focused.
2. Use dependency injection to access other Spring beans.
3. Handle exceptions properly to ensure clean application startup.
4. Use `@Order` annotation to control execution order when necessary.
5. Consider using `@Conditional` annotations for environment-specific runners.
